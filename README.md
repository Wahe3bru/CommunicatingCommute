analysing my commute

I started cycling to work
- rehabilitate my knee damaged in an accident
- avoid sitting in traffic and
- get fit and healthy.

After 3 years, I started using Strava to record my daily commute in December of 2016.
In 2018 I interned/studied.
Thought it would be interesting to analyse my typical commute in 2017 with my 2018 commute.

Unfortunately 2019 is the year of no commute ;( 
Hopefully 2020 will be my commute comback !!
